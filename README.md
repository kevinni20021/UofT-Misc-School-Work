Projects and assignments I have worked on during my undergraduate studies at UofT. All of the work provided are completely (or almost completely) original and I have obtained Instuctor permission before uploading them here.

## STA314 Introduction to Statistical Learning
### Assignment 1 Question 5
Using R and the GLM Net package, I explored basic machine learning concepts. For this assignment, I explored how different training data sizes and polynomial degrees affect the accuracy of the model.

### Assignment 2
For this assignment, I used VIX to explore different periods of the historical stock market and see what factors are the largest influence in each time period. For each feature I used EMV (Equity Market Volatility) trackers to measure the market sentiment around that topic. Using elastic nets, lasso, and ridge regression, I conducted feature selection and tuned hyperparameter to build a model that can somewhat accuractely predict the market given a time period.

## STA304 Surveys, Sampling and Observational Data
### Course Project
Explored the relationship between personal finance and academic performance. Using R, we conducted a variety of statistcal tests on data we collected via a survey of our class. Created by Chris Cheong, Qinhui (Tiger) Huang, Check Hin (Chris) Leung, Kevin Ni, Ian Quan, Mingrui (Eddie) Yang, Yupeng Zhan.

## STA305 Experimental Design
### Course Project (WIP)
Currently in progress. Our topic of interest is exploring the factors affecting FPS in games. Created by Chris Cheong, Qinhui (Tiger) Huang, Kevin Ni, Jacob Gipp, Mingrui (Eddie) Yang, Yupeng Zhan.

## MAT344 Introduction to Combinatorics
### Portfolio
Proofs, calculations and reflections for the course compiled into one document. Some areas that this portfolio explores include: genearting functions, graph theory, and trees.
